# MiAR
Message in AR

**MiAR** is a chat application for the augmented world.

## User Stories

* [] Users are able to login/signup.
* [] Users are able to write, draw, embed picture in a canvas provided by the app in the compose view.
* [] Users can place the drawn canvas to a place in the AR view.
* [] The canvas frame is hinged to a lat/lng (or maybe more granular location indicator).
* [] There are several ideas for who/how the canvases gets communicated.
  * [] Directly send canvas to named user(s), probably from their FB list or phone number network.
  * [] Broadcast the canvas in a particular location. Whenever other users are detected in that location, they receive the message and can see the canvas in the AR view.

Caveat:
We might need to change a few details as we go since we are unsure of the feasibility of some of the user stories which are largely dependent on ARKit.
